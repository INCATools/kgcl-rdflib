    comments:
      - >-
        Note there is not yet consensus in how this should be done in rdf/owl implementations. Simply marking the edge deprecated with render it visible to most clients.
        Care must be taken because simply adding a deprecation tag to an axiom does not silence it -- it is still asserted.
        It is therefore more common to obsolete an edge by shadowing the axiom as an annotation. See the Mondo docs for example

      - value: "rename UBERON:0002398 from 'manus' to 'hand'"
      - value: "move 'hand' from 'part of' 'hindlimb' to 'part of' 'forelimb'"

      - value: "search and replace 'metabolic process' with 'metabolism' in all labels under 'biological process'"
