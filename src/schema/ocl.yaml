  change:
    description: >-
      Any change perform on an ontology or knowledge graph

  simple change:
    description: >-
      A change that is about a single ontology element
    slots:
      - about
      - old value
      - new value

  complex change:
    description: >-
      A change that is is a composition of other changes
    slots:
      - change set

  transaction:
    description: >-
      A unified set of changes. Could be a single change, or the results of an ontology diff
    slots:
      - change set
      
  change mixin:
    mixin: true
    description: >-
      root class for all change mixins

    slot_usage:
      about:
        domain: edge

  node move:
    is_a: edge change
    description: >-
      A node move is a combination of deleting a parent edge and adding a parent edge, where the edge label is preserved and the object/parent node changes
    examples:
      - value: changing a is-a b to a is-a c
    slot_usage:
      change description:
        string_serialization: "move {about} from {old value} to {new value}"

  edge label change:
    is_a: edge change
    examples:
      - value: changing a is-a b to a part-of b
    slot_usage:
      change description:
        string_serialization: "changing relationship between {about.subject} and {about.object} from {old value} to {new value}"

  node rename:
    is_a: node change
    slots:

  node deletion:
    is_a: node change
    mixins:
      - deletion
    description: >-
      Deletion of a node from the graph. Note it is recommended nodes are obsoleted and never merged,

      change description:
        string_serialization: "deleting {about}"

  node obsoletion with merge:
    is_a: node obsoletion
    description: >-
      An obsoletion change in which information from the obsoleted node is moved to a single target
    slot_usage:
      target:
        multivalued: false
      change description:
        string_serialization: "merging {about} into {target}"

  node obsoletion with split:
    is_a: node obsoletion
    description: >-
      An obsoletion change in which information from the obsoleted node is moved selectively to multiple targets
    slot_usage:
      target:
        multivalued: true
      change description:
        string_serialization: "splitting {about} into {target.join(' ')}"

      The secondary entity on which the change operates

  old value:
    description: >-
      The value of a property held in the old instance of the ontology

  new value:
    description: >-
      The value of a property held in the old instance of the ontology

  change description:
    description: >-
      A string serialization of the change
