SimpleChange - A change that is about a single ontology element DatatypeChange EdgeChange - A change in which the element that is the focus of the change is an edge. EdgeCreation - An edge change in which a de-novo edge is created. The edge is potentially annotated in the same action. PlaceUnder - An edge creation where the predicate is owl:subClassOf EdgeDeletion - An edge change in which an edge is removed. All edge annotations/properies are removed in the same action. EdgeLogicalInterpretationChange - An edge change where the subjet, object, and predicate are unchanged, but the logical interpretation changes EdgeObsoletion - An edge change in which an edge is obsoleted. EdgeRewiring - An edge change where one node is replaced with another, as in the case of obsoletion with replacement NodeMove - A node move is a combination of deleting a parent edge and adding a parent edge, where the predicate is preserved and the object/parent node changes NodeDeepening - A node move in which a node where the destination is a proper descendant of the original location. Note that here descendant applied not just to subclass, but edges of any predicate in the relational graph NodeShallowing - The opposite of node deepening PredicateChange - An edge change where the predicate (relationship type) is modified.

The language should be a higher level of abstraction than a low-level owl or rdf diff.

An example of a NodeMove instance, correcting an incorrect placement from being part-of leg to part-of arm: [ a kgcl:NodeMove ; kgcl:about UBERON:0002398 ## manus kgcl:old_value UBERON:0002103 ## hindlimb kgcl:old_predicate BFO:0000050 ## part_of kgcl:new_value UBERON:0002102 ## forelimb kgcl:new_predicate BFO:0000050 ## part_of ] Apply and Diff operations Change objects can be used in two directions: Diff: given two ontologies O1 and O2, generate a list of changes C Apply: Given a list of changes C, apply to ontology O1 to generate O2 The Diff operation is intended to be used to provide KG/Ontology authors a high level view of changes. The Apply operation can take diffs as inputs. The diffs can have different serializations: A direct instantiation of the classes design in the model, in one of: JSON YAML RDF A string serialization A tsv serialization, for use in spreadsheets For example an instance of a rename class on Uberon to change the primary label of an entity may be: [ a kgcl:NodeRename ; kgcl:about UBERON:0002398 ; kgcl:old_value \"manus\" ; kgcl:new_value \"hand\" ] This can be serialized as rename UBERON:0002398 from 'manus' to 'hand' TBD: we also want an even more compact form: rename 'manus' to 'hand' There are a few user stories for the Apply operation: As an ontology contributor, I want to quickly describe and apply a change to an ontology, so that I do not have to clone a github repo, open protege, make a PR As an ontology tool creator, I want to generate \"suggestions\" for changes to an ontology, so that a human user can spot-check them and apply all valid ones Example: a tool that makes suggested lexical changes to text defs to conform to standards An OWL logic tool may suggest redundant axioms that can safely be removed. The curator feels safest vetting these via the intermediate form Intended use in GitHub One intended killer app for this language is the ability for a human or agent to specify a set of changes in a GitHub ticket in a human-readable transparent way, and for a bot to create a PR from the computable description in the ticket.
