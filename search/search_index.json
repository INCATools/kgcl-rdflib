SimpleChange - A change that is about a single ontology element DatatypeChange EdgeChange - A change in which the element that is the focus of the change is an edge. EdgeCreation - An edge change in which a de-novo edge is created. The edge is potentially annotated in the same action. MappingCreation - A specific kind of edge creation in which the created edge is a mapping. PlaceUnder - An edge creation where the predicate is owl:subClassOf EdgeDeletion - An edge change in which an edge is removed. All edge annotations/properies are removed in the same action. EdgeLogicalInterpretationChange - An edge change where the subjet, object, and predicate are unchanged, but the logical interpretation changes EdgeObsoletion - An edge change in which an edge is obsoleted. EdgeRewiring - An edge change where one node is replaced with another, as in the case of obsoletion with replacement NodeMove - A node move is a combination of deleting a parent edge and adding a parent edge, where the predicate is preserved and the object/parent node changes NodeDeepening - A node move in which a node where the destination is a proper descendant of the original location. Note that here descendant applied not just to subclass, but edges of any predicate in the relational graph NodeShallowing - The opposite of node deepening PredicateChange - An edge change where the predicate (relationship type) is modified. LogicalAxiomChange - A simple change where a logical axiom is changed, where the logical axiom cannot be represented as an edge NodeChange - A simple change where the change is about a node AddNodeToSubset - Places a node inside a subset, by annotating that node NodeAnnotationChange - A node change where the change alters node properties/annotations. TODO NodeAnnotationReplacement - A node annotation change where the change replaces a particular property value. TODO NodeCreation - a node change in which a new node is created ClassCreation - A node creation where the owl type is 'class' NodeDeletion - Deletion of a node from the graph.

The language should be a higher level of abstraction than a low-level owl or rdf diff. For example, conceptually, changing the parent of a class in ontology is a single event, which can be broken down into a delete and add operation (see NodeMove ). An example of a NodeMove instance, correcting an incorrect placement from being part-of leg to part-of arm: [ a kgcl:NodeMove ; kgcl:about UBERON:0002398 ## manus kgcl:old_value UBERON:0002103 ## hindlimb kgcl:old_predicate BFO:0000050 ## part_of kgcl:new_value UBERON:0002102 ## forelimb kgcl:new_predicate BFO:0000050 ## part_of ] Examples See the examples/ folder Apply and Diff operations Change objects can be used in two directions: Diff: given two ontologies O1 and O2, generate a list of changes C Apply: Given a list of changes C, apply to ontology O1 to generate O2 The Diff operation is intended to be used to provide KG/Ontology authors a high level view of changes. The Apply operation can take diffs as inputs.
