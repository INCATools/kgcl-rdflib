title: knowledge graph change language ontology model
description: >-
  A basic bare-bones model of an ontology or ontology-like structure. The purpose is not to provide a complete model,
  rather just sufficient structure for domain and range constraints in the ocl model

    is_a: ontology element
    description: >-
      Any named entity in an ontology. May be a class, individual, property
    slots:
      - id
      - name
      - annotation set
      - owl type

  class node:
    aliases:
      - concept
    is_a: node
    description: >-
      A node that is a class
    class_uri: owl:Class

  instance node:
    aliases:
      - named individual
    is_a: node
    description: >-
      A node that is an individual
    class_uri: owl:NamedIndividual

  edge:
    aliases:
      - triple
      - axiom
      - relationship
    is_a: ontology element
    description: >-
      A relationship between two nodes.
      
      Currently the only kinds of edges supported in KGCL:

        * A subClassOf B <==> Edge(subject=A, predicate=owl:subClassOf, object=B)
        * A subClassOf P some B <==> Edge(subject=A, predicate=P, object=B)
        * P subPropertyOf Q <==> Edge(subject=P, predicate=owl:subPropertyOf, object=Q)

      These represent the most common kind of pairwise relationship between classes,
      and classes are the dominant node type in ontologies.
        
      In future a wider variety of OWL axiom types will be supportedn through the use
      of an additional edge property/slot to indicate the interpretation of the axiom,
      following owlstar (https://github.com/cmungall/owlstar).

      For example:
       * `A subClassOf R only B <==> Edge(subject=A, predicate=P, object=B, interpretation=AllOnly)`
       * `A Annotation(P,B) <==> Edge(subject=A, predicate=P, object=B, interpretation=annotationAssertion)`

      Note that not all axioms are intended to map to edges. Axioms/triples where the object is a literal
      would be represented as node properties. Complex OWL axioms involving nesting would have their own
      dedicated construct, or may be represented generically. These are out of scope for the current
      version of KGCL
