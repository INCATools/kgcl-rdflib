The goal is to provide a high level abstracted graph-oriented change
language that is intended for describing changes in ontologies and
ontology-like artefacts. The level of abstraction is intentionally at
a higher level than either RDF or OWL. It currently does not attempt
to encapsulate all of OWL. Instead it focuses on the majority of
operations performed on ontologies.
